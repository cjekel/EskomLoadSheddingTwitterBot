#EskomLoadSheddingTwitterBot
A python script that tweets when the Eskom load shedding stage changes. This script powers the twitter bot [@LDShedStatus](https://twitter.com/ldshedstatus). 

#How it works
EskomLoadShedddingTwitterBot is a python script which utilizes Twython to tweet, when the Eskom api changes the load shedding status. It stores an offline copy of the load shedding status in loadSheddingStatus.txt. The python script then compares the offline load shedding value to the value from the Eskop api. If the values are different, the python script tweets the new load shedding status and updates the offline load shedding value. The offline load shedding values are stored to match the load shedding stage. So a value of 0 represents Stage-0, while a value of 3 represents Stage-3 load shedding.

#How to use
Simply run the python script as often as you would like. I've included a shell script, checkStatusAndTweet.sh, which runs the python script every five minutes.

To run the shell script in a Linux environment, simply execute 'sh checkStatusAndTweet.sh' in your favorite terminal.

You will need to create a [twitter application key](https://dev.twitter.com/oauth) in order to use [Twython](http://twython.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). Then you must update the key values in the python script in order to login and post from your twitter account.
